# App Prueba

This is a test project to demonstrate the use of Angular 12. It contains all the specifications described in the test guide. In this case I'm not using any template to show all I can create in this technology.

## Get Started

### Clone the Repo

- Go to the shell
- Clone this repository
- Command: "git clone "

## Install

- We need to verify the packages described in the file "package.json"
- Install with the commands "npm install (name of package)"

## Scripts

Verify you are in the root carpet to use the command:
- ng serve --open

## Better App

- To be a better app I recommend to have a authentication system to use correctly the guard component.
- More cretive interface
